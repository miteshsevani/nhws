    "University is full of new experiences, new people and new ideas. Whilst you should be open to these, it is important to be aware that there are groups with ulterior motives. Do not get caught out. Have a good group of friends. Look out for your friends if they start to become withdrawn, have any other unusual changes in behaviour or show any of the signs of grooming mentioned, make an effort to find out what is going on with them. Stay in control and never let indecent photos be taken."
