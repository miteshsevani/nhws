    "Alcohol and drugs are often used in grooming. Alcohol can be spiked with date rape drugs such as rohypnol, G.B.H. Drugs such as these are odourless, tasteless and colourless and they are easily added to food and drink without you realising. Date rape drugs affect you within 10 minutes of taking them and last for 24 hours. Such drugs are hypnotic, may cause amnesia and may have dissociative effects."
