        "Grooming is when someone builds an emotional connection with you to gain your trust for the purposes of sexual abuse leading to conversion to another faith. Many victims do not understand that they have been groomed or that what has happened is abuse.",
        "Grooming starts with the offender targeting and profiling suitable girls to be exploited or converted. Over time the girlsâ€™ trust may be gained by attention, flattery and gifts. The intention of the offender is to draw the girl in more deeply, by making her feel special and then to isolate her from friends and family. Groomers often seek out girls usinBirmighamg social media.",
        "Once the relationship is sexualised the offender will take advantage by threats, blackmail and exposure unless demands are fulfilled. Once the offender gains control the girl is subject to further manipulation and eventually she will be left isolated and destitute, with little or no help available."

        "Alcohol and drugs are often used in grooming. Alcohol can be spiked with date rape drugs such as rohypnol, ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (G.B.H). Drugs such as these are odourless, tasteless and colourless and they are easily added to food and drink without you realising. Date rape drugs affect you within 10 minutes of taking them and last for 24 hours. Such drugs are hypnotic, may cause amnesia and may have dissociative effects."

Do not get caught out. Have a good group of friends. Look out for your friends if they start to become withdrawn, have any other unusual changes in behaviour or show any of the signs of grooming mentioned, make an effort to find out what is going on with them. Stay in control and never let indecent photos be taken."
